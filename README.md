**Vedantu YouTube Content Automation Tool**

---

### 🚀 Problem Statement

Vedantu publishes 1,000+ videos/month across 25+ YouTube channels, but high-quality video production heavily relies on individual Master Teachers. This causes scalability bottlenecks and inconsistent output. The goal is to automate this pipeline end-to-end: from idea generation to video upload.
